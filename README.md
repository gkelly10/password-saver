Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mongodb, Node, Express, EJs.


Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or wow I actually did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.


This was good practice on back end development and understanding of EJs syntax.
